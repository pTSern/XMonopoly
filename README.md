# XMonopoly

> Like the other traditonal Monopoly game, here, you still have to manage your money and your property. To win the game you still need to cause your oponents to be bankrupt. 
So what is the different? In this game, you can beat your oponents ass to make them losing their health point which is the represent of the amount of damage that the current 
controlling champion of the player can take before begin death. Its essentially a measureof how much damage a champion can sustain before they are knocked out or killed. 
After being killed, if the champion remain some life (the current life is bigger than 0), the champion will be repsanw in the Hospital, which is a special property in the game.
